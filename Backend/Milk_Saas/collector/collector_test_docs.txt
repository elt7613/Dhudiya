# Collector App Test Documentation

## Overview
This document provides detailed documentation for the test cases in the Collector app. The tests are organized into three main classes:
1. ModelTests - Testing model functionality
2. APITests - Testing API endpoints and integration
3. SerializerTests - Testing serializer behavior

## Test Setup
All test classes use Django's TestCase framework and include a comprehensive setUp method that creates:
- A test user
- A test customer
- A test rate step
- A test market price
- A test collection record

## 1. ModelTests
Tests the basic functionality of all models in the collector app.

### Setup
- Creates test instances of User, Customer, RateStep, MarketMilkPrice, and Collection models
- Sets up basic test data with realistic values

### Test Methods

#### test_customer_str
- Purpose: Tests the string representation of Customer model
- Verifies that str(customer) returns the customer's name
- Expected output: "Test Customer"

#### test_collection_str
- Purpose: Tests the string representation of Collection model
- Verifies that str(collection) returns "{customer} - {date} {time}"
- Expected output: "Test Customer - {date} morning"

#### test_rate_step_str
- Purpose: Tests the string representation of RateStep model
- Verifies that str(rate_step) returns "{milk_type} - {rate_type}"
- Expected output: "cow - rate per kg"

#### test_market_milk_price_str
- Purpose: Tests the string representation of MarketMilkPrice model
- Verifies that str(market_price) returns the price as string
- Expected output: "45.00"

#### test_soft_delete
- Purpose: Tests soft deletion functionality for all models
- Verifies that:
  - Soft-deleted objects are not visible in normal queries
  - Soft-deleted objects are still in database (accessible via all_objects)
- Tests all four models: Customer, Collection, RateStep, and MarketMilkPrice

## 2. APITests
Tests the REST API endpoints and their functionality.

### Setup
- Creates test user and authenticates API client
- Creates test instances of all models
- Sets up test data with realistic values

### Test Methods

#### test_customer_list
- Purpose: Tests GET /api/collector/customers/
- Verifies:
  - Response status is 200 OK
  - Returns correct number of customers
  - Proper pagination

#### test_customer_create
- Purpose: Tests POST /api/collector/customers/
- Verifies:
  - Can create new customer
  - Response status is 201 CREATED
  - Customer count increases

#### test_collection_list
- Purpose: Tests GET /api/collector/collections/
- Verifies:
  - Response status is 200 OK
  - Returns correct number of collections
  - Proper pagination

#### test_collection_create
- Purpose: Tests POST /api/collector/collections/
- Verifies:
  - Can create new collection
  - Response status is 200 OK
  - Collection count increases

#### test_rate_step_list
- Purpose: Tests GET /api/collector/rate-steps/
- Verifies:
  - Response status is 200 OK
  - Returns correct number of rate steps
  - Proper response format (dict or list)

#### test_rate_step_create
- Purpose: Tests POST /api/collector/rate-steps/
- Verifies:
  - Can create new rate step
  - Response status is 201 CREATED
  - RateStep count increases

#### test_market_price_list
- Purpose: Tests GET /api/collector/market-milk-prices/
- Verifies:
  - Response status is 200 OK
  - Returns correct number of market prices
  - Proper pagination

#### test_market_price_create
- Purpose: Tests POST /api/collector/market-milk-prices/
- Verifies:
  - Can create new market price
  - Response status is 201 CREATED
  - MarketMilkPrice count increases

#### test_collection_filters
- Purpose: Tests collection filtering functionality
- Tests filters for:
  - Date range (date_from, date_to)
  - Milk type
  - Customer ID
- Verifies correct filtering behavior

#### test_rate_step_filters
- Purpose: Tests rate step filtering functionality
- Tests filters for:
  - Milk type
  - Rate range (min_fat_rate, max_fat_rate)
- Verifies correct filtering behavior

#### test_authentication_required
- Purpose: Tests authentication requirements
- Verifies:
  - Unauthenticated requests return 401
  - Tests all main endpoints
  - Proper error responses

#### test_user_specific_data
- Purpose: Tests data isolation between users
- Verifies:
  - Users can only see their own data
  - Other users' data is not accessible
  - Proper data filtering

#### test_generate_invoice
- Purpose: Tests invoice generation endpoint
- Verifies:
  - Can generate PDF invoice
  - Correct content type
  - Proper parameter handling
  - Response status is 200 OK

## 3. SerializerTests
Tests the serializer functionality and validation.

### Setup
- Creates test user
- Sets up test data for customer and collection

### Test Methods

#### test_customer_serializer
- Purpose: Tests CustomerSerializer validation
- Verifies:
  - Can serialize customer data
  - Proper validation of fields
  - Required fields are enforced

#### test_collection_serializer
- Purpose: Tests CollectionDetailSerializer validation
- Verifies:
  - Can serialize collection data
  - Proper validation of fields
  - Required fields are enforced
  - Customer relationship validation

## Best Practices Demonstrated
1. Comprehensive Setup: Each test class has thorough setUp method
2. Isolation: Tests are independent and don't affect each other
3. Coverage: Tests cover models, APIs, and serializers
4. Authentication: Tests verify security requirements
5. Data Integrity: Tests verify data isolation between users
6. Error Handling: Tests verify proper error responses
7. Filtering: Tests verify query parameter handling
8. Soft Deletion: Tests verify proper handling of soft-deleted records

## Running the Tests
To run the tests:
```bash
python manage.py test collector
```

To run specific test class:
```bash
python manage.py test collector.tests.ModelTests
python manage.py test collector.tests.APITests
python manage.py test collector.tests.SerializerTests
```

To run specific test method:
```bash
python manage.py test collector.tests.APITests.test_generate_invoice
```
